##################### Board-computer communication #####################
make patmos 
# when fine most of the time
# then it failed on the connection of the FPGA: JTAG does not match
# Error (213019): Can't scan JTAG chain. Error code 87.
make synth 
# this one suprisingly worked :O
make config 
# failed on the same procedure as the FPGA

# Running the same thing on the other board

cd ~/t-crest/patmos/
cd # it is necessary to compile somewhere???
make app APP=appname
# For an example see the hello app, which can be built and downloaded with:
make app config download APP=hello

# Fixing the hardware connection with the board:
#add the programming user account
sudo usermod -a -G dialout user
#now log out from Ubuntu and login again
jtagconfig
#try out the jtag chain
sudo killall -9 jtagd
#kill and verify that the process is not running
jtagconfig
#re-run this command until it has no errors
#re run the whole project synth again, for fucks shake
make config
#and re-run this shit until it downloads properly

##################### Building c apps #####################
# go to the folder where the .c code is
cd ~/t-crest/patmos/c/apps/hello
# convert from c to elf 
patmos-clang -o ~/t-crest/patmos/tmp/hello.elf hello.c
# within the same folder: patmos-clang -o hello.elf hello.c

# compile app (it has the same name as the .c file)
